## Introduction:

**GaitLocomotionSystem** ia a plugin that is intended to allow designers to create Thread Safe Layered Animation Blueprints with ease. Many functions of this plugin are completely optional, but allow for designers to easily have replicated thread safe variables for most of the necessary requirements for animation. Including an optional Aim Solver in the GaitAnimComponent.

The purpose of this plugin is to have a highly performant tool for animation design, that holds up to larger scale development without bottlenecks in memory, whilst minimizing the animation budget where possible utilizing things like Animation Warping, or Distance Matching.

Gait Locomotion System also includes many quality of life features for animation work, including 2 example Character Movement components (One integrated with GAS to allow for easy network synchronized movement updates using GameplayEffects). A Cosine Movement input function is also included to modify input values, preventing some movement hacks, but also making movement rates more accurate for Bipedal rigs.

Lastly there is an Optional Data Driven, Gameplay Tag, Property Based Player Camera Manager Setup that can easily be used to manage Camera States, Post Process, and Interpolation.
